## Moving to Projects In This Repo:

#### Rain Alert

Stay ahead of the weather with the Rain Alert project. Using the Twilio API, this project sends text messages to users (using twilio api) if rain is forecasted for the day. The code is deployed to the cloud and automatically runs at 8 AM daily, ensuring users are informed about impending rain showers. Never get caught without an umbrella again!

#### International Space Station Tracker

Experience the wonders of space with the International Space Station (ISS) Tracker project. This project tracks the ISS using APIs to determine its location. It then leverages another API to check the clarity of the night sky. If the ISS is within a 500km radius of set location and the sky is clear, the project sends an email alert, inviting you to your terrace to witness a shooting star. It's a breathtaking opportunity to connect with the cosmos from the comfort of your home.

#### Additional Projects

* **Web Scraping:** Dive into web scraping with the AmazonPriceFinderBS4 project, leveraging Beautiful Soup for efficient data extraction.
* **Scheduling:** Explore task scheduling principles in the BirthdayManager project, potentially utilizing scheduling libraries like schedule.
* **Hardware Interaction (Exploration):** While CoffeeMachineCode may not directly control a coffee machine, it delves into hardware interaction libraries (e.g., serial) for future endeavors.
* **Social Media Automation (NOT RECOMMENDED):** Discover basic automation in the InstaFollowerBot project, but exercise caution with social media platform terms of service.
* **API Interaction:** Engage with APIs for data retrieval in the IntSpaceStationTracker project, potentially employing libraries like requests.
* **Weather Monitoring (Rain Alert):** Stay informed with the RainAlert project, utilizing weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to trigger timely notifications. It employs Twilio API to send text messages to users if rain is forecasted, automatically running daily at 8 AM via cloud deployment.
* **International Space Station Tracker:** Experience the wonder of space with the IntSpaceStationTracker project. It tracks the ISS using APIs and then monitors the sky's clarity during nighttime, alerting users via email if the ISS is within 500km radius from their location and the sky is clear, inviting them to witness a shooting star from their terrace.

#### Tools Utilized

* Python 3 (specific version adapted to your environment)
* Used multiple api endpoints to track things and render messages.
  
#### Project Structure

Each project folder includes:

* Python script files (e.g., main.py)
* Supplementary Python files for specialized functionalities
* Requirement files (requirements.txt) detailing external libraries used

#### Disclaimer

The InstaFollowerBot project is intended for educational purposes only. Always adhere to the terms of service of social media platforms when employing automation tools.

#### Future Enhancements

* Will expand each project with additional features and capabilities as per time bandwidth.
* Will add Unit tests for robust code maintenance in further free time.
